# The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method used to acquire a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution 
where direct sampling is difficult. This sequence can be used to compute an integral or to estimate the distribution.
