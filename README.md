# The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method used to acquire a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution 
where direct sampling is difficult. This sequence can be used to compute an integral or to estimate the distribution.

We will explore three different probability density functions, the first is 2-dim and bimodal, the other two are 10-dim and unimodal MVNs
